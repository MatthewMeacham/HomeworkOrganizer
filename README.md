## Purpose of this Application

Orgnizer is a website that enables students to keep track of their assignments much like they would in a planner. This application can be used on any device that can access the internet. Additionally, support was added for parents to manage their children's accounts so that parents can help instill good study habits into their children. Also, teachers can create accounts and find students which they can then assign assignments to so that students don't have to do it themselves. This application is extremely useful for teaching kids good study habits, how to use a computer, and organizational skills.

### Further Explanations of Important Features

Orgnizer is totally free for everyone - students, parents, and teachers. This way, Orgnizer can help everyone without the worries of being blocked by inability to pay.

Orgnizer was made with usability in mind. Every task has been streamlined and has become as simple as possible. Furthermore, this application is fully mobile responsive and can be used on any device no matter the resolution size. In addition, customizability was a key concern with us; every aspect of your experience can be customized to fit your style: If you want your math class to be represented by black, then you can represent it with black! Also, the colors red, yellow, and green help show you how soon your assignments are due so you can prioritize what you need to do.

Organization is at the heart of what Orgnizer does. We enable users to create classes to which they can add assignments to keep track based on classes. Also, Orgnizer enables you to specify what kind of assignment the assignment is: Test, Project, Homework, etc. These organization abilities help users know exactly what needs to get done, when to do it, and what they are doing it for.

One of the big features in Orgnizer is the ability for parents to create accounts. Parents can then create accounts for their kids to use, and the parents can monitor and manage their kids' assignments. This will help parents show their kids how important organization skills are. Furthermore, parents can then print off their students assignments and make sure that the kids finish their assignments.

Another really cool feature added to Orgnizer is the ability for teachers to create accounts. Teachers can add students to their classes and then assign assignments which then are assigned to all the students in their class. This way it takes the burden off of the student, but still promotes organization skills.
